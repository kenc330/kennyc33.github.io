                            <p><strong>Tonkotsu Ramen (豚骨ラーメン)</strong> is a ramen dish that originated in
                                Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture on the Kyushu island of Japan, and it is a
                                specialty dish in both Fukuoka and Kyushu. The soup broth is based on pork bones and
                                other
                                ingredients, which are typically boiled for several hours, and the dish is traditionally
                                topped with sliced pork belly and served with ramen noodles that are hard in the center.
                                In
                                Fukuoka, Japan, tonkotsu ramen is referred to as Hakata ramen. <a class="wiki"

                            <div class="menu_header">Directions: <br><br>Tonkotsu Base</div>
                            <p><strong>Step #1 - </strong>Fill a pressure cooker 2/3rds of the way with water and bring
                                to a boil. Add
                                the pig trotters to the boiling water and cook until you stop seeing red blood come out
                                of the bones (about 10-15 minutes). The idea is to draw out as much of the gunk as
                                possible into this first batch of water. Transfer the trotters to a bowl of cold water
                                then repeat with the leg bones and chicken bones (you can use the same water).</p>
                            <p><strong>Step #2 - </strong>Dump the now very dirty water down the drain and wash the pot.
                                Scrub any dark brown scrum off all the bones and rinse them thoroughly. Return the
                                cleaned bones to the pot and cover with water (the water should come up an inch above
                                the top of the bones). Bring the pot to a boil and skim off any chunks or foam that
                                floats to the surface. Keep doing this until you don't seen any more foam or scum
                                floating up. This will take about 30 minutes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Step #3 - </strong>While the bones are going, Heat 1/2" of oil in a pot over
                                medium heat and add the head of garlic and ginger. Fry this until they are browned and
                                shriveled up. Use a slotted or wire mesh to transfer the ginger and garlic to a bowl.
                                Add the onions to the oil and fry these until caramelized and shriveled. Add the fried
                                onions to the ginger and garlic and set aside.</p>
                            <p><strong>Step #4 - </strong>Once the stock is scum-free, add the caramelized ginger,
                                garlic, and onions, along with the white pepper to the stock. Affix the pressure cooker
                                lid and cook on high pressure for 1 hour and 45 minutes. If you don't have a pressure
                                cooker, cover with a lid and cook at a boil for 5-6 hours (you may need to check and add
                                water periodically, the bones should be mostly covered in water).</p>
                            <p><strong>Step #5 - </strong>Once the pressure is released use tongs to remove and discard
                                all the bones. Remove any chunks of pork and set aside for another use. Strain the stock
                                into a bowl and skim off any excess fat.</p>
                            <div class="menu_header">Directions: <br><br>Mayu (black garlic oil)</div>
                            <p><strong>Step #1 - </strong>To make the black garlic oil, add the sesame oil into a small
                                saucepan along with the grated garlic. Put the pan over medium low heat and let the
                                garlic cook stirring occasionally until it is very dark brown. When the garlic is very
                                dark, turn the heat down to low and let it cook until it is black.</p>
                            <p><strong>Step #2 - </strong>As soon as it hits black, turn off the heat and transfer the
                                hot oil and garlic to a heatproof bowl. Let this mixture cool down completely. Add the
                                cooled oil to a blender or food processor and blitz until there are no visible garlic
                                particles left and the oil is uniformly black.</p>
                            <p><strong>Step #3 - </strong>It will taste burnt and slightly bitter, but this is okay as
                                you only add a little bit to each bowl. Put it the oil in a container and refrigerate
                                until you are ready to use it.</p>
                            <div class="menu_header">Directions: <br><br>Tonkotsu Ramen</div>
                            <p><strong>Step #1 - </strong>Heat the tonkotsu base in a sauce pan. In a bowl whisk
                                together the tahini, chashu liquid, grated garlic, salt, mirin and white pepper. Add
                                this to the hot broth and whisk to combine. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Bring to a
                                simmer, then add the sesame seeds and pork fat and whisk to combine.</p>
                            <p><strong>Step #2 - </strong>Split the cooked noodles between two bowls. Pour the tonkotsu
                                soup over the noodles. Top with chashu, scallions and whatever else you want to add.
                                Finish the ramen with a drizzle of mayu on each bowl.</p>
